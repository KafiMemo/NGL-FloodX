## üìã Description

NGL-FloodX is an educational tool designed to demonstrate how web automation works with NGL.link profiles. This project was created purely for research and educational purposes to understand request handling and API interactions.

This cross-platform tool works on Windows, Linux, and Android (via Termux) and features secure access via encrypted files. It automatically configures itself based on your operating system, providing valuable insights into system detection and configuration.

## üéì Educational Value

This repository serves as a practical example for learning about:
- Cross-platform Python and Node.js development
- System environment detection and adaptation
- Secure file encryption and decryption techniques
- Web request automation fundamentals
- Ethical considerations in software development
